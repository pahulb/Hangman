# C++ - Hangman

## Background
A C++ project for fun

## Description
* Very old-fashioned hangman game played on the command prompt with no images, like the days of DOS
	
* Three options: Start Game, Load File, Exit
	
	 - Start Game, starts the game
	 - Load File allows users to import their own word list from a text file. Words must be separated by a new line. 
	    Words with numbers and/or special characters have those characters stripped.
	 - Exit closes the game
	  
* Three difficulties: 
	
	 - EASY = 12 guesses
	 - NORMAL = 6 guesses
	 - HARD = 6 guesses but with every incorrect guess, the current guessing word will change to a different word in the list
	  
* After the end of every game, the user will be returned to the main menu.
	
* A lot of error checking, from checking valid inputs to stripping special characters and numbers from words in a word list.

## How to Run Game
   - Copy the code in my repository and paste it into a c++ IDE like codeblocks.
   - For codeblocks you would paste it into the main.cpp section.
   - Then you would press the yellow gear button to build and green play button to run the code and then play the game.
   - In order to load a file you will need to add a file into the IDE by clicking on project at the top and pressing add files.
   - Then you would select the the number 2 option which is load files and type the file name.
