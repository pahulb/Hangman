# C++ - Hangman

## Background
A C++ project for fun

## Description
* Very old-fashioned hangman game played on the command prompt with no images, like the days of DOS
	
* Three options: Start Game, Load File, Exit
	
	 - Start Game, starts the game
	 - Load File allows users to import their own word list from a text file. Words must be separated by a new line. 
	    Words with numbers and/or special characters have those characters stripped.
	 - Exit closes the game
	  
* Three difficulties: 
	
	 - EASY = 12 guesses
	 - NORMAL = 6 guesses
	 - HARD = 6 guesses but with every incorrect guess, the current guessing word will change to a different word in the list
	  
* After the end of every game, the user will be returned to the main menu.
	
* A lot of error checking, from checking valid inputs to stripping special characters and numbers from words in a word list.

## Install
Download the application file (.exe), run it, play! If you want to create your own word list, take a look at the SampleWordList file, save it to the same folder as the application file.
	
## This project is final and for demonstration purposes only.
